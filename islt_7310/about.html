            <p>My name is Hayden Mueller, and I am a middle and high school social studies teacher based in Tokyo, Japan. Originally from rural Ohio, I pursued undergraduate studies on the East Coast. While studying abroad in Vienna, Austria, I met my now wife, a Japanese citizen. I originally studied theater and was planning to continue my studies in an MFA program, but in my senior year of undergrad, I completed a research thesis in German Studies that changed my priorities. Studying the education programs created to indoctrinate young German women into the Nazi <em>Schutzstaffel</em>, I became intensely interested in the role curriculum plays in worldview formation. After graduating college in May 2019, we relocated to Tokyo, and I have since rigorously pursued professional development opportunities in the field of education. I am, right now, particularly interested in students' online research skills and ways to refine instruction of effective, cross-discipline research methodologies. I'm committed to continuous development as a pedagogue and global citizen.
