            <h3>Current Approaches to Information Literacy Instruction</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Through my experience working in both education at Tokyo Academics and Spark Student Research, and through my work in policy research at Women without Borders, I have come to see firsthand the significant digital literacy deficiencies in classroom across subject areas and grade levels. Students are interacting with the web almost incessantly, but our pedagogy has not evolved to adequately prepare them for these interactions. In fact, it often sabotages them. Many teachers still adhere to lengthy lists of questions when helping students determine the legitimacy of online sources, and they push students to read deeply into a website to assess its credibility.</p>
           
            <h3>Problems With And Solutions To These Approaches</h3>
            <p class="subparagraph">Unfortunately, these methods are counterproductive. Students cannot reasonably be expected to memorize a list of 30 questions or to spend the time to ask all of them of a website. Similarly, when teachers push students to closely analyze a given internet source, they waste precious time and are that much more likely to ascribe value to the content within. When students are exposed to radicalizing information, these tactics turn from time-wasting to potentially deadly.</p>
           
            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p class="subparagraph">We have a responsibility as educators to update our instruction to the shifting digital information landscape. I have begun this practice by furthering my own education through both the University of the People and the University of Missouri. By strengthening my own competencies in information literacy, I will better serve my students and act as a role model for them when conducting research.  Equipped with these skills, I foresee myself building out a program for digital civics at my school.</p>

            <h3>Alignment With Teaching Philosophy</h3>
            <p class="subparagraph">As a teacher, I aim to consistently model growth and humanity for my students by collaborating with my colleagues, admitting my own mistakes to the class and my peers, and improving my own pedagogical practice through research, practice, and reflection. My classroom is grounded in democratic principles and the belief that all students deserve to learn under the ideal circumstances for them. We explore universal human themes to better understand the diversity of peoples in our classroom, and we draw on the expertise of our greater community to deepen learning. Guided by these themes and a boundless curiosity, I hope to contribute to any learning institution I find myself in.</p>
