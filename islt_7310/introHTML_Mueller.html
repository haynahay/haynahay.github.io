    <p>Hi, everyone! My name is Hayden, and I teach middle and high school history at an after-school tutoring center in Tokyo, Japan. I am originally from Ohio in the United States but have lived in Tokyo since the summer of 2019. I have no experience in web development, so I am very much looking forward to developing those competencies in this course. I am hoping to acquire additional licensure in computer science, as I see significant need in this field and want to hone my information technology literacy so that I can better serve my students. This is my first course at the University of Missouri, and I am curious to see how the university and the School of ISLT specifically approaches pedagogy. I do have experience with online learning, having earned a Master of Education degree online. Outside of work, I love hiking and have spent over 4 months on the Appalachian Trail.</p>
